# Kitchen Sink

A handy copy and paste with most of the current HTML elements. Plus my new gulp config and some placeholder assets.

Includes some content because what is a website without content. For your enjoyment these are Alan Partridge quotes.

## Dependencies

You're gonna need gulp-cli `npm install -g gulp-cli`

I've included jQuery because my tabs script uses it and to be honest is a website a website without jQuery? Don't answer that.

## Installation

Clone this then run `npm install`

## Versions

- 1.01 Removed bower and grunt and replaced with gulp. Added open graph and twitter card meta tags and every fucking favion that devices seam to need these days.

- 1.02 Added more input types and `srcset` attributes to images. Also some additional copy in the content section

## To do

- [ ] Update gulp to newest version 
- [ ] Check the current spec and add additional elements.
- [ ] Build out navigation component

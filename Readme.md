# Kitchen Sink

A handy copy and paste with most of the current HTML elements.

Includes some content so you can see what you typography looks like, which are mostly made from Alan Partridge quotes. Dan.

## Dependencies

You're gonna need gulp-cli `npm install -g gulp-cli`

I've included `jquery` because my tabs script using jquery and to be honest is a website a website without jquery. Don't answer that.

## Installation

Clone this then run `npm install`


## Versions

- 1.01 Removed bower and grunt and replaced with gulp. Added open graph and twitter card meta tags and every fucking favion that devices seam to need these days.

## To do

Check the current spec and add additional elements. I'm thinking video, audio and shit like that.

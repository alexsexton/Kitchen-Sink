# Kitchen Sink

A lightweight and complete framework for projects.

## Key Points

Lean, standards compliant and accessible re-usable code and modules.

CSS classes with consistent and relevant naming conventions. 

We'll use jQuery and only include components common to all projects.

Should work down to IE7 - it'll hopefully degrade nicely.

## HTML

Based loosely on HTML5 Boilderplate

Use semantic class names when naming things.

## CSS

Any element with a role= gets the same class name.

Name elements using only classes. 

Use .js-[name] or #js-[name] for hooking into JavaScript/jQuery

Do not nest selectors more than 3 levels deep. We want the output to be efficient.

Remove any rules that are not needed and cleanse before production

## Design Standards

Margins and padding based on multiples of 15px at 960px. 

Typography 19px @ 1:1.618 (base font size) 960px @ 1:1.618 (outer wrapper width)

## JS Components

  - Tabs
  - Responsive Accessible Navigation
  - Image Sliders (bxslider)
  - Sticky Nav
  - Accordion
  - Placeholder Text
  - Matchmedia
  - Enquire

Call jQuery first from Google, then if this fails call locally. Try to use ARIA roles on JS components to increase accessibility.
